CHANGELOG

== 0.2.2

* Bug fix - decimal defaults are compared correctly.
* Bug fix - escaped ' in enum elements partially solved.

== 0.2.1

* Bug fix - cast :unique => nil to false in DbIndex.

== 0.2.0

* Switched to using the new style 'change' block in the generated
  migrations, rather than 'up' or 'down'. This bumps the Sequel
  requirement to at least 3.18.0.
* Changes in indexes are properly handled - not just if the names
  are different.
